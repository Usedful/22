Q.3 Design a Django application: An admin site that lets you add, change and delete 
programming languages.

Ans ->

1) Update poll/admin.py:
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import ProgrammingLanguage

admin.site.register(ProgrammingLanguage)

2) Run the development server:
python manage.py runserver

3) Access the admin site at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/.
Log in with the superuser credentials that you created during createsuperuser command.
Navigate to the Programming Languages section.
Here, you can add, change, and delete programming 
languages directly through the Django admin interface.

4) Optional: Customize admin views

You can customize the admin views for the Programming Language model by 
creating a poll/admin.py file and using the ModelAdmin class. 
For example:

from django.contrib import admin
from .models import ProgrammingLanguage

class ProgrammingLanguageAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ('name', 'votes')
    search_fields = ['name']

admin.site.register(ProgrammingLanguage, ProgrammingLanguageAdmin)
